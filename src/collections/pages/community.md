  * **C: Want to Create Change** that is systemic, holistic, self-directed,
  centered in CORE values, and integrated/aligned from the inside-out

  * **O: Make Changes Organic:** That is, a transformation that is natural, easy-to-understand, and based on principles that have historically proven effective for individuals, leaders, teams & organizations

  * **R: Reduce** Noise (distractions from inside & outside), conflict, stress, second-guessing, wasted effort, long-standing obstacles & avoidable self-sabotage.

  * **E: And to do so with Ease:** The Balancing Act moves organizations, teams, and leaders from unease or disease into lasting Ease, Flow, Synergy--and sets the direction of an upward evolutionary spiral.
