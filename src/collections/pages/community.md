    **Core Coaching & Consulting, LLC and our sister organization, Core Learning
    Services, Inc,** have joined forces to create the global CORE Community
    where you can further develop your own Balancing Act skills, meet
    like-minded colleagues, AND support the non-profit Core Learning Services as
    it brings *The Balancing Act* programs to teachers and at-risk youth all
    over the world. 


    You can participate in the CORE community at any level: attend our FREE monthly events, be the first to access our resources as soon as we develop them, and "pay it forward" by bringing the superpower of Balance to the lives of the next generation.
