      title: The Superpower of Balanced Leadership in Unbalanced Times
      description: "This book is much more than the words on its pages: it is an
        introduction to a new way of thinking about leadership, one that will
        provide you with increased meaning, hope, and a wider range of power. It
        is a logical, easy-to-follow, proven strategy—a road map you can use
        forever. In includes an invitation to a global community that will
        support you in becoming the confident leader people trust to bring them
        safely through our currently unpredictable times. It is a gateway to a
        wealth of continually growing free resources. And lastly, this little
        but powerful book contains our fervent hope for your complete success,
        our desire that you become the whole leader and good person we believe
        is your true nature…and who the world needs now, more than ever.  The
        expertise in this book is priceless. It will save you countless days,
        even months, of trial and error because we are passing on to you a
        treasure-trove of breakthrough knowledge we have gleaned from decades of
        hard-won, first-hand experience. Our goal is to keep you from going off
        track by pointing out common errors and specific ways you can avoid
        them.  The road map outlined here is easy to follow, with color-coded
        icons serving as road signs at each step on the path.  Balanced
        Leadership is both pragmatic and philosophical. You will become a more
        effective leader in your current role while simultaneously expanding
        your thinking about what the best leadership practices will be in our
        post-pandemic era. With the exciting new paradigm of balanced
        leadership, you will always have as your guide The Balancing Act’s
        logical, elegantly simple, unifying strategy rather than just an
        assortment of good tactics. (In fact, you can better leverage the good
        tools you already have within the holistic, unifying strategy we offer
        here.)    Let me suggest that you use this book to jumpstart your new
        leadership journey today (for less than it cost you for this morning’s
        coffee and breakfast bar). Doing so will ensure that you arrive sooner
        rather than later at your destination of being the superpowered leader
        and truly great human being you have long wanted to be.    Balanced
        Leadership will also help you clarify YOUR own way of leading so you can
        confidently tap into your own unique gifts, become more comfortable in
        your own skin, trust your instincts, expand your capabilities, and
        enthusiastically learn what you need from us and many other experts to
        whom we will refer you.  Indeed, if you dive into the instructions in
        this book, it will be as if you are receiving individual coaching from
        its author, Sharon Seivert (who charges up to a thousand times the price
        of this book for her coaching packages). What’s more, this book offers
        you a warm invitation to the global CORE Community where you can have
        real-time, inspiring, and caring conversations with the author and our
        international colleagues. We would be thrilled to have you join us.  The
        book will steer you away from common leadership errors and keep you from
        becoming discouraged as you face one problem after another. As you
        increase your understanding of, and comfort with, this new way of
        leading, you will steadily build your resilience, confidence, and even
        your day-to-day ease. We know that, as a leader, you are already used to
        handling challenging problems, and that you probably already do that
        quite well. It’s just that, we are offering you this book, so that these
        daily tasks become a lot easier for you.  In Balanced Leadership, you
        will receive a complete toolkit of six different powers you can use
        through good times and bad…times when you need to repair damage and
        re-stabilize so things are in a better place…and times when you could
        proactively grow yourself, your team, and your whole system to the next
        level of evolution. As you align these 6 different powers, you will
        transform yourself into a superpowered whole leader who can more
        comprehensively resolve complex and confusing issues, especially now, in
        these unbalanced times. Indeed, this book will show you how to seize the
        opportunity this in-between time offers so you can transform what could
        be the worst of times into the best of times."

      title: The Balancing Act
      description: >-
        The Balancing Act is the foundational work for all Core Coaching &
        Consulting programs, books, apps, and products. The Balancing Act (TBA)
        shows how you can change your own life, work, and relationships by
        implementing its 6-step holistic, systemic process.


        Since The Balancing Act was published in 2001, it has grown into a global movement of business and educational coaches, consultants, change agents, and teachers who deploy its powerful pragmatic programs, online assessments, and practical data-driven interventions to significantly increase the odds of success for companies who want to become more agile, leaders who want to be more effective, and individuals who want to create more meaningful work, develop healthier relationships, and lead happier lives.

      subtitle: Mastering the 5 Elements of Success in Life, Work and Relationships
    - title: 6 Steps to Leading Your Life and Work
      description: >-
        This book is a call to the quest, a practical guide to becoming a
        real-life Hero at this crossroads in history. "How?" you ask...by using
        The Balancing Act’s step-by-step systemic, holistic change process to
        transform these “worst of times” (pandemic, recession, climate, & social
        shifts) into the “best of times”. That is, rather than be defeated, you
        will emerge on the other side of this global transition more powerful,
        clear, purpose-driven, and happier than you imagined possible. 

        I urge you to take heart, be courageous, and become pragmatically, carefully optimistic so you can immediately implement TBA’s 6-step COREvolutionary process. By deliberately changing yourself from the inside out, you will be able to take complete responsibility for your whole life so your ability to respond to crises will be magnified many times over. What's more, you will create many positive ripple effects in your community, workplace, and world.

      description: >
        Este libro es una llamada a la acción. Te pide que te conviertas en
        héroe de la vida real, empezando hoy mismo. Te muestra cómo actuar con
        mayor efectividad asumiendo total responsabilidad en tomar las riendas
        de tu vida y tu trabajo para que tu confianza, tu poder y tu capacidad
        de respuesta ante una crisis aumenten exponencialmente. 

        Confío en que este libro te inspire a elegir el optimismo pragmático en este crítico punto de inflexión.   Aunque a simple vista el optimismo pragmático puede parecer simplista, o incluso temerario, te insto a que lo pruebes porque es una estrategia de cambio lógica que cimentarás una y otra vez en la realidad de tu experiencia diaria. Y con ello, aumentarás las probabilidades de atravesar las tormentas actuales de manera segura. 

        La hora de ruta paso a paso y minuciosa que se detalla en Tomar las riendas de tu vida y tu trabajo te ayudará a tener mayor confianza, agilidad y resiliencia, de manera que te sientas impulsado a avanzar constante e inexorablemente hacia tus objetivos. Este libro también te ayudará con las herramientas prácticas de implementación para superar cualquier obstáculo que te puedas encontrar en este viaje.

      description: "In this new e-book, Sharon shows how The Balancing Act methodology
        can help you prosper in every possible way -- a timely topic for these
        times of global economic crises! Even if other wealth-building
        approaches have failed you in the past, Prospering can work wonders for
        you. There are many reasons why. First and foremost, Prospering is based
        on The Balancing Act, a powerful change process that shows you how to
        start wealth-building from your Core (your center, essence, soul). In so
        doing, Prospering supplies you with a powerful internal moral compass so
        you can maintain strong balance, confidence, and calm while building new
        wealth, from the inside out. Additionally, Prospering eases conflict and
        pain so you can create win-win-win ripple effects that benefit you, the
        people you love, and many others. And lastly, Prospering is a unified,
        systemic approach in which you can make just one small improvement in
        one aspect of your wealth and then leverage it via multi-level learning
        to increase other forms of wealth you desire. "

      description: "Incluso si otros enfoques para generar riqueza te han fallado en
        el pasado, estoy convencida de que Prosperar puede hacer maravillas por
        ti, y hay muchas razones de porqué.  En primer lugar y más importante,
        Prosperar se basa en The Balancing Act, un poderoso proceso de cambio
        que te muestra cómo empezar a construir riqueza desde tu Esencia (tu
        centro, núcleo, alma).  Con ello, Prosperar te proporciona una poderosa
        brújula moral interna para que puedas mantener un firme equilibrio,
        confianza en ti mismo y calma mientras generas nueva riqueza, desde
        dentro hacia afuera. Además, Prosperar alivia el conflicto y el dolor
        para que puedas crear una reacción en cadena en la que todos ganan y que
        es beneficiosa para ti, para tus seres queridos, y para muchas otras
        personas. Y, por último, Prosperar es un enfoque unificado y sistémico
        en el que puedes realizar simplemente una pequeña mejora en un aspecto
        de tu riqueza y, luego, aprovecharla mediante el aprendizaje en
        múltiples niveles para aumentar otras formas de riqueza que desees. "
