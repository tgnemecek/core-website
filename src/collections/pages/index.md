  - testimonial: During a crossroads in my career, Sharon coached me to overcome
      obstacles and doubts, and then supported me in making a bold decision that
      I've never regretted. What's more, Sharon has achieved similar amazing
      results with patients I've since referred to her.

  - testimonial: Leading Your Life & Work helped me to find myself in this changing
      world. I learned wonderful techniques to remove obstacles, find my center
      and my purpose, connect with real and achievable goals. I feel like I had
      a puzzle with some missing pieces and The Balancing Act program has helped
      me to find them and put them in the proper place, to continue growing and
      discovering my own path.

  - testimonial: I feel happier and more hopeful and confident about being able to
      make changes in my life because I feel I have the tools to make them
      happen. I was once again reminded that life is too short not to deal with
      personal issues that can make me a happier and more fulfilled person. I
      have a better understanding of the Elements of Success and how to keep
      them in balance in my life. Thank you for the opportunity to participate
      in this life changing program.
