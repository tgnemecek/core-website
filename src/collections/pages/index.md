    title: The Balancing Act
    description: >-
      The Balancing Act is the foundational work for all Core Coaching &
      Consulting programs, including Leading Your Life and Work. TBA describes
      how you can implement a holistic, systemic, logical and pragmatic 6-step
      process that will change your own life, work and relationships in ways you
      want--and in doing so, help you positively impact the world around you. 


      Since the original publication of The Balancing Act in 2001, the ideas contained in these pages have grown into a global movement. Seivert has built an international network of business and educational colleagues, plus developed a comprehensive series of pragmatic programs, online assessments, supportive interventions, and practical measurements of progress--all of which have contributed to significantly increasing the odds of success for individuals and companies in transition.


      In these pages you will find the foundational body of work that led to this rich development of effective interventions for people from all walks of life, ranging from wealthy business owners and senior leaders to career changers to new entrepreneurs to beleaguered teachers, parents and at-risk youth.
