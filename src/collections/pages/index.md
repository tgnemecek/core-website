  - testimonial: During a crossroads in my career, Sharon coached me to overcome
      obstacles and doubts, and then supported me in making a bold decision that
      I've never regretted. What's more, Sharon has achieved similar amazing
      results with patients I've since referred to her.

  - testimonial: Leading Your Life & Work helped me to find myself in this changing
      world. I learned wonderful techniques to remove obstacles, find my center
      and my purpose, connect with real and achievable goals. I feel like I had
      a puzzle with some missing pieces and The Balancing Act program has helped
      me to find them and put them in the proper place, to continue growing and
      discovering my own path.
