    title: The Balancing Act
    description: >-
      The Balancing Act is the foundational work for all Core Coaching &
      Consulting programs, including Leading Your Life and Work. TBA shows you
      how to change your own life, work and relationships by implementing its
      6-step holistic, systemic process.


      Since The Balancing Act was published in 2001, it has grown into a global movement of business and educational change agents who deploy its powerful pragmatic programs, online assessments, and practical data-driven interventions to significantly increase the odds of success for companies who want to become more agile, leaders who want to be more effective, and individuals who want to lead happier lives and have more meaningful work.

  - title: 6 Steps to Leading Your Life and Work
    description: >-
      This book is a call to the quest, a practical guide to becoming a
      real-life Hero at this crossroads in history. "How?" you ask...by using
      The Balancing Act’s step-by-step systemic, holistic change process to
      transform these “worst of times” (pandemic, recession, climate, & social
      shifts) into the “best of times”. That is, rather than be defeated, you
      will emerge on the other side of this global transition more powerful,
      clear, purpose-driven, and happier than you imagined possible. 

      I urge you to take heart, be courageous, and become pragmatically, carefully optimistic so you can immediately implement TBA’s 6-step COREvolutionary process. By deliberately changing yourself from the inside-out, you will be able to take complete responsibility for your whole life so your ability-to-respond to crises will be magnified many times over. What's more, you will create many positive ripple effects in your community, workplace, and world.
