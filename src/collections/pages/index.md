  - testimonial: During a crossroads in my career, Sharon coached me to overcome
      obstacles and doubts, and then supported me in making a bold decision that
      I've never regretted. What's more, Sharon has achieved similar amazing
      results with patients I've since referred to her.

  - testimonial: The Leading Your Life & Work program helped me to find myself in
      this changing world. I am so excited, looking forward to develop a new
      Project with my students. I learned wonderful techniques to remove
      obstacles, find my center and my purpose, connect with real and achievable
      goals. I feel like I had a puzzle with some missing pieces and The
      Balancing Act program has helped me to find them and put them in the
      proper place, to continue growing and discovering my own path.
