      the computer systems and other technology. A long-time entrepreneur,
      Rafael immediately saw the possibilities of TBA to help all sorts of
      people, ranging from at-risk youth and adults in transition. A native
      Argentinian, now resident of Cambridge, MA, Rafael is eager to bring TBA
      via his organizing, educational and media skills to all parts of Central

      in international organizations. He has been working with the developer of

      find their foundation in the leader's personal change. Auke combines
      business with the human aspect in his consulting, and his approach is
      direct, open, honest and of a powerful simplicity. Auke works as an
      executive coach, change process facilitator, and a consultant on
      leadership development, team building, career transitions, cultural
      issues, strategic business planning, mergers and starting new companies.
      He is (co) author of the booklet "Happy at Work" and gives interactive,
      in-depth workshops on Leadership and Organizations in Balance.
