    bio: 'Sharon Seivert is the leader of Core Coaching & Consulting (CCC). Prior to
      launching CCC, Seivert served as the CEO of a Group Health Plan that
      established an industry record for earliest-ever break-even. Seivert
      authored "The Balancing Act", the foundational book that first outlined
      the 6-point system CCC uses for all its work. As both a US and EU citizen,
      Sharon loves few things more than spending time with her international
      family, friends, colleagues, and clients. She is pictured here in her
      front yard on the North Shore of Boston where she enjoys spending her time
      while not coaching leaders, working with global colleagues, or writing new
      books. Her latest ebooks are "Prospering: 6 Steps to Great Wealth" and  "6
      Steps to Leading Your Life and Work (from the Inside Out)". '

    bio: Auke is an experienced businessman with 20 years of management experience
      in international organizations. He has been working with the developer of
      The Balancing Act, Sharon Seivert, since 2004. As a precondition for
      working on leadership in organizations, Auke starts from the principle
      that everything that happens around the leader says something about the
      leader--and that the desired changes in the organization therefore always
      find their foundation in the leader's personal change. Auke combines
      business with the human aspect in his consulting, and his approach is
      direct, open, honest and of a powerful simplicity. Auke works as an
      executive coach, change process facilitator, and a consultant on
      leadership development, team building, career transitions, cultural
      issues, strategic business planning, mergers and starting new companies.
      He is (co) author of the booklet "Happy at Work" and gives interactive,
      in-depth workshops on Leadership and Organizations in Balance.
