    bio: Sharon Seivert is leader of the Core Coaching & Consulting Team and author
      of "The Balancing Act", the foundational book that first outlined the
      6-point system CCC uses for all our work. As both a US and EU citizen,
      Sharon loves few things more than spending time with her international
      family, friends, colleagues and clients. Sharon is pictured here in her
      front yard on the North Shore of Boston where she enjoys spending her time
      while not coaching leaders, working with global colleagues, or writing new
      books (her latest is "6 Steps to Leading Your Life and Work (from the
      Inside Out)"

    bio: Rafael Medina has been involved in The Balancing Act work, even before the
      official launch of Core Coaching and Consulting. Rafael and Sharon met
      while she and other colleagues were delivering the first Opportunity
      Knocking program for ex-prisoners at a half-way home where Rafael managed
      the computer systems and other technology. A long-time entrepreneur,
      Rafael immediately saw the possibilities of TBA to help all sorts of
      people, ranging from at-risk youth and adults in transition. A native
      Argentinian, now resident of Cambridge, MA, Rafael is eager to bring TBA
      via his organizing, educational and media skills to all parts of Central
      and South America.
