      Knocking program for ex-prisoners at a half-way home where Rafael managed
      the computer systems and other technology. A long-time entrepreneur,
      Rafael immediately saw the possibilities of TBA to help all sorts of
      people, ranging from at-risk youth and adults in transition. A native
      Argentinian, now resident of Cambridge, MA, Rafael is eager to bring TBA
      via his organizing, educational and media skills to all parts of Central
      and South America.
