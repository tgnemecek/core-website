  * **Create business Change** that is systemic, holistic, self-directed,
  centered in CORE values, and integrated/aligned from the inside-out

  * **Make Changes Organic:** That is, changes that are natural, easy-to-understand, and based on principles that have historically proven effective for individuals, leaders, teams & organizations

  * **Reduce** Noise (inside or outside the system), conflict, stress, second-guessing, wasted effort, long-standing obstacles & self-sabotage.

  * **And do so with Ease:** The Balancing Act moves organizations, teams, and leaders from unease or disease into Ease, Flow, Synergy--and sets the direction of an upward evolutionary spiral.
