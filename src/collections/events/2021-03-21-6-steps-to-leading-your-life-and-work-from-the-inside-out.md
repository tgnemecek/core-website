subtitle: A Powerful 8-week Program to Create the Life and Work of Your Dreams
description: >-
  Core Coaching & Consulting is now offering an updated strategy and
  implementation program that meets the urgent needs of people coming out of the
  global pandemic and economic crises. For this new program based on *The
  Balancing Act's* pragmatic,  systemic, strategic approach to making successful
  change, we have doubled the service hours you will receive, significantly
  decreased the program's cost, and included three one-on-one private sessions
  that will tailor the program to meet your special needs. Our intention with
  these improvements is to increase the odds of your being able to create
  optimal individual life & professional work solutions post-crisis. 


  This comprehensive program can help you dramatically increase your odds of success if you: a) want to make big changes in your life or work, b) would like to explore the viability of starting your own business, c) want to become a more effective leader, or d) would like to rebalance your life and work when it is time to emerge into a new normal.


  In this updated 20-hour live on-line transition program, you will work with expert coaches (in life, career, and business) to generate these **PRACTICAL & IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**
