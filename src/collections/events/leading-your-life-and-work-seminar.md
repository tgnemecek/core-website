title: Leading Your Life and Work Seminar
subtitle: A new world of work has been forced upon us. Learn how you can
  powerfully move your career forward or find a new path in uncertain times.
description: >-
  **Part 1**: In this seminar, you will learn a proven process for reshaping
  your career - one that has helped thousands of people before you. It is based
  on generating strong action rooted in your individual CORE gifts, so you
  create a much more satisfying new work and life.
  **Part 2:** Breakout into small groups with CORE coaches to discuss how you can apply the CORE transition process to your own career path. Small groups will be in your preferred language (English or Spanish).
  **Part 3.** Introduce the post-session care package. This includes a video/audio of the session (so you can review the materials anytime). You will also receive check-in texts from your coach, plus other career resources.
  CORE Coaching & Consulting is an international team of coaches based in the US, Europe and South America. We use the Balancing Act principles of CORE Coaching President Sharon Seivert as a basis for this seminar.
  We hope you use this experiential workshop to jumpstart your career during these challenging times.
