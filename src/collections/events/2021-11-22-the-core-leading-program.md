  This live bi-weekly program will be delivered in 8 sessions (on separate days
  and times in the US and Europe) for leaders who want to up their game.  This
  very rich program includes private Executive coaching sessions, individual
  leadership assessments, and "just-in-time" coaching between group sessions. 


  The goal is to provide an alternate systemic leadership strategy that dramatically increases your odds of successfully implementing the changes you want to make, including blasting through all obstacles in your path.
