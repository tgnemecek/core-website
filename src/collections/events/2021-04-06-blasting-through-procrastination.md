title: Blasting through Procrastination
subtitle: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
description: >-
  Most of us have problems with procrastination...we say we want to get
  something done that's important to us--but then we don't do it. But sometimes
  procrastination is a good thing! So...the first step in this procrastination
  breakthrough process is to determine if the procrastination you're
  experiencing is good or bad for you. 


  After you decide the "why" of the procrastination, you'll know what to do, and be able to move fast forward by following the steps  to break out of procrastination and move to accomplish your goals. 


  This seminar is a stand-alone offering for those who are feeling discouraged because they are stalled by procrastination -- and a bonus for participants of the Productivity Seminar or the Leading Your Life and Work Seminar.


  You will also receive detailed instructions on the procrastination process so you can return whenever you wish to blast through procrastination.
