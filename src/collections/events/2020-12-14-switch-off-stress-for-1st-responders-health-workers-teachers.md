title: Switch Off Stress for 1st Responders, Health Workers & Teachers
subtitle: The CORE team will teach you fast techniques to reduce 6 different
  kinds of stress--all of which you may be feeling right now.
description: >-
  **Part 1**: We treat you to a "spa experience" by teaching you how to reduce 6
  different kinds of stress, anytime, anywhere. In this session, you can sit
  back in the comfort of your own home and we will take care of YOU, for a
  change!


  **Part 2:** Breakout into small groups with CORE coaches to discuss your stress challenges, what techniques you found most practical, and how to bring them into your daily life and work. Small groups will be in your preferred language (English or Spanish)


  **Part 3.** Introduce the follow-up SOS Care package. This includes a video/audio of this "spa" session (so you can return anytime--and bring your family or friends with you). You will also receive check-in texts from your coach, plus other SOS resources including the SOS: Switch Off Stress app for iPhone.


  CORE Coaching & Consulting is an international team of coaches based in the US, Europe and South America. We use the Balancing Act principles of CORE Coaching President Sharon Seivert as a basis for this seminar.


  We hope you use this experience and these tools to increase your health and well-being during these challenging times.
