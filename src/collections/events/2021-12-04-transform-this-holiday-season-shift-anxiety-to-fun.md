subtitle: Shift Anxiety to Fun this Holiday Season!  Join us December 21 @ Noon ET
description: >-
  For many people, 2021 has NOT been a wonderful year at all!! So let us help
  you turn things around for you in these last days of December. 


  Please come to our End of Year Party! Click this link to save your space for this Free Event.  <https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88264689878?pwd=UFhGMDZuQzh6RXltVjgrU1IwazVOZz09>


  We will then confirm your reservation so your spot is saved and also send you a booklet so you can get the most out of our time together. See you very soon.


  We will celebrate with old friends and new from across the world (and we'll have two language channels to make that easier -- English and Spanish). 


  Hope to see you there!
