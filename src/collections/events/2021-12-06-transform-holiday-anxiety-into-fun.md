title: Transform Holiday Anxiety into Fun
subtitle: Join our end-of-a-tough-year Party on December 21st at NoonET
description: >-
  Let's face it -- 2021 was a very tough year for most people. So please join
  our fun event where you'll learn about specific ways to kick your holiday
  season and 2022 into high gear. 


  When you register to save your space for this Free Event, we will confirm your reservation so your spot is saved and also send you a booklet so you can get the most out of our time together. 


  We will celebrate with old friends and new from across the world (...and we'll have two language channels to make that easier -- English and Spanish).


  Watch the invitation video below to learn more and to meet your hosts, Sharon & Bonnie.


  Hope to see you there!
