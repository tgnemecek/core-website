title: "Forgive & Forget: Make this the Best Valentine's Day Ever"
subtitle: A CORE Community Monthly Event
description: >-
  All of us have been disappointed in love–otherwise, there would not be so many
  sad songs all over the world. However, we don’t need to keep remembering how
  bad it was, we don’t need to keep replaying how much we were hurt and how that
  SOB is not even sorry!


  The bad news is that this old love lost may be keeping you from a future love gained. This year, we will help you stop hating and start loving again.


  Join us to let that old bad relationship go forever. Experience the amazing relief of releasing old disappointments and toxic relationships. These awful experiences can result in lingering PTSD and create shadows that cloud over your emotions, so you continue to protect yourself, staying small and stuck.


  In this session, we’ll help you leave at least one of these burdens behind forever!  AND what’s even better: you will learn how to do the *Forgive & Forget* process on your own so you can continue to release burdens you no longer want to carry. 


  Join us if there’s someone you still need to forgive. (Maybe even–yourself?)
